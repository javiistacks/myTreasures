Bootstrap - The elegant style and feel of Shoe Inventory incorporates several of the styling tools pioneered and perfected by Bootstrap.

Handlebars - My Treasures is held together by a Handlebars framework that was carefully crafted to suit the needs of an interactive experience necessary to make Shoe Inventory a reality.
