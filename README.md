## Technologies Used

HTML/CSS/Javascript - Garage Sailor was built using these core technologies. Both hand-crafted code and robust libraries were used to create the features necessary to give Garage Sailor a modern style, with an easy-to-use experience.

Bootstrap - The elegant style and feel of Garage Sailor incorporates several of the styling tools pioneered and perfected by Bootstrap.

Handlebars - Garage Sailor is held together by a Handlebars framework that was carefully crafted to suit the needs of an interactive experience necessary to make Garage Sailor a reality.

Heroku - Garage Sailor is now accessible from anywhere in the universe that has access to the world wide web thanks to the Heroku cloud platform and their willingness to aid developers by allowing for free and easy app deployment.

JawsDb - All the data needed to deliver the experience to the Garage Sailor is housed inside of JawsDb.

MySQL - All data creation and manipulation takes place using the MySQL dialect.

Sequelize - Connections, data handling and delivery, and database management is handled using the Sequelize library.

Node - Servers were built on the Node.js platform. Using an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment allowed us to customize many available libraries to suit Garage Sailor.

Express - Express was chosen for its fast, unopinionated, and minimalist qualities as our web framework for Garage Sailor.

Git - As with all projects, Git remains invaluable to the creation, development, communication, and support of Garage Sailor.
